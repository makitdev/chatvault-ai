# Your conversations. Your knowledge. Your control.

ChatVault AI transforms public ChatGPT conversations into a local, searchable
knowledge base with SQLite storage, PDF/DOCX export, Ollama embeddings, and
retrieval-augmented chat that cites its sources.

## Why ChatVault AI

ChatVault AI is built around one rule: **SQLite is the source of truth, and the
vector index is disposable.** Conversations and messages are stored locally in
SQLite. The ChromaDB collection can be deleted and rebuilt from SQLite at any
time. Chat and embeddings run against a local Ollama instance, so conversation
text is not sent to a hosted model.

<div class="cv-grid" markdown>

<div class="cv-card" markdown>
### Import public shares
Fetch a public `chatgpt.com/share` URL, extract the message tree, and store it
locally with duplicate detection.
</div>

<div class="cv-card" markdown>
### Export real documents
Download a styled PDF or an editable DOCX with headings, lists, tables, quotes,
task lists, and fenced code blocks.
</div>

<div class="cv-card" markdown>
### Search with embeddings
Chunk conversations by message, embed them through Ollama, and query the closest
passages with ChromaDB cosine search.
</div>

<div class="cv-card" markdown>
### Ask with citations
Retrieve context, ask the local chat model, and show the numbered source chunks
behind every answer.
</div>

## Feature status

The status column describes the code in the `v1.0.0` release. Features marked
**API only** exist in the backend but do not have a dedicated screen in the React
frontend.

| Capability | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public ChatGPT share URL import | Implemented | `chatgpt.com/share/<id>` only; no login, ZIP upload, or private chats |
| SQLite conversation and message storage | Implemented | Source of truth; duplicate imports return the existing record |
| Conversation library and viewer | Implemented | Title filter, date/message filters, sorting, delete, Markdown transcript |
| PDF and DOCX export | Implemented | Per conversation, from the viewer or API |
| Message-aware chunking | Implemented | Chunks never cross message boundaries |
| Ollama embeddings and ChromaDB index | Implemented | Explicit embeddings only; cosine distance |
| Per-conversation and bulk indexing | Implemented | Synchronous; single process-wide indexing lock |
| Index status, delete, and rebuild | Implemented | Rebuild recreates the ChromaDB collection |
| Semantic search | Implemented | `POST /api/v1/search`; no dedicated frontend search screen |
| Retrieval-augmented chat | Implemented | Cited sources; no-source path skips the chat model |
| Dashboard and system status | Implemented | SQLite counts, index coverage, Ollama and ChromaDB health |
| Authentication and multi-user access | Not implemented | Single-user local application; bind to loopback |
| Background jobs and streaming | Not implemented | Requests run synchronously; chat is non-streaming |
| ChatGPT data-export ZIP import | Not implemented | Only public share URLs are supported |
| Hosted model providers | Not implemented | Ollama is the only model runtime |
| Automated backup scheduling | Not implemented | Back up `storage/chatvault.db` manually |

The backend is the only component that talks to ChatGPT, Ollama, SQLite, and
ChromaDB. The browser talks to the backend over JSON and downloads generated
documents. See [Architecture](concepts/architecture.md) for component
responsibilities and failure boundaries.
